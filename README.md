# Data Science Portfolio

A growing portfolio of end-to-end data projects across machine learning engineering, analytics, and reproducible experimentation. The focus is on production-minded workflows (clean structure, reproducibility, and clear documentation), and this repository can evolve over time as projects expand or new ones are added.

## 📁 Projects

### 🏥 Hospital Readmission Risk Prediction (End-to-End)

An end-to-end machine learning project that predicts hospital readmission risk from patient/hospital data and demonstrates an industry-style workflow: ingestion (DuckDB) → model training/evaluation → API (FastAPI) → demo UI (Streamlit) → experiment tracking (MLflow) → containerization (Docker).

📌 Location: `projects/health-readmission-risk/`

### 📊 Healthcare Outcomes Analysis (SQL)

A comprehensive SQL analytics project modeling a hospital domain (patients, admissions, diagnoses) and showcasing advanced SQL techniques (CTEs, window functions, stored procedures) for outcomes and readmission analysis.

📌 Location: `projects/healthcare-outcomes/`

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Python**: data processing + modeling (scikit-learn), API (FastAPI), UI (Streamlit)
- **SQL / DuckDB**: reproducible local analytics + feature preparation
- **MLflow**: experiment tracking
- **Docker / Docker Compose**: portable demo environment

## 🚀 How to Use This Repository

Each project under `projects/` is self-contained and includes its own README with:

- setup instructions
- reproducibility steps
- how to run demos (API/UI/Docker)

Start here:

1. Open the project folder under `projects/`
2. Follow that project's README
